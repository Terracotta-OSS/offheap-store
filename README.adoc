= OffHeap Store

OffHeap Store is a library that provides a set of map and cache implementations
that store data outside of the normal Java heap.  Additionally it provides a
bunch of interesting things to support these functions that might be interesting
in isolation to some people.

== What's Available
On the surface OffHeap Store contains implementations of:

 * Map (non thread-safe)
 * ConcurrentMap (single stripe or segmented; read-write locked or exclusively locked)
 * Set (but use +Collections.newSetFromMap(Map)+ instead)
 * Clock Cache (single stripe or segmented; read-write locked or exclusively locked)

Additional functionality includes:

 * Cache Entry Pinning
 * Eviction Listeners
 * _Non-fault tolerant_ disk backend

Things that might be interesting to some:

 * Per entry metadata (very basic API)
 * Serialization optimization (redundant ObjectStreamClass descriptor compression)
 * Native heap-alike implementation (+OffHeapStorageArea+)
 * A (crude) weak identity hash map (because the world needed one more)

== Structure

Like all software OffHeap Store is just a big stack of abstractions, rough structure starting at
the bottom and working up.

[horizontal]
  +BufferSource+::       +ByteBuffer+ factories [+org.terracotta.offheapstore.buffersource+]
  +PageSource+::         +Page+ factories, that uses ByteBuffers) [+org.terracotta.offheapstore.paging+]
  +OffHeapStorageArea+:: native heap-alike that uses pages)
  +StorageEngine+::      provide storage for POJOs, some use +OffHeapStorageArea+)
  +OffHeapHashMap+::     core map implementation, uses storage engine for K/V storage and a page for the hashtable.
  a million subclasses:: all the map derivatives: concurrent, evicting (caches), et al.
